# inteliNotes

This project was created for a Frontend Hackathon using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The idea is to build a simple note-taking app that allows users to add, edit, and delete notes, as well as copy their content to the clipboard. Notes are stored in the browser, so they remain available even after you leave or reload the page.

## Features

- **Add notes**: Create new notes easily.
- **Copy to clipboard**: Click the copy icon to instantly copy a noteâ€™s content to your clipboard.
- **Delete notes**: Remove notes at any time.
- **Real-time search**: The search bar filters notes as you type.
- **Persistence**: Notes are saved using **localStorage**, so they stay available even after reloading or closing the page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structuring the content.
- **CSS** for styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript** to make the app interactive.
- **Clipboard API** for copying note content.
- **localStorage** to save notes and ensure they persist across sessions.
